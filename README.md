# Zig-Windows-Vscode Workspace Template

This template is intended to be a jump-off point for setting up a Zig project on Windows using VSCode. Feel free to customize this template to better fit your project's needs.

## Features

- Recommendations for the bare minimum VSCode extensions required.
- Launch configurations for debugging the binary and debugging tests, along with the associated tasks.
- Additional tasks for running tests and creating a release build (note that the release build task depends on the run tests task).
- Boilerplate for the three main files: `main.zig`, `root.zig`, and `tests.zig`.
- Minimal `.gitignore`. *(check the [comments](https://github.com/kiffpuppygames/zig-windows-vscode-workspace-template/blob/main/.gitignore))*
- A modularized `build.zig`.
